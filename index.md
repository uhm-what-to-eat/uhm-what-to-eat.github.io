## Community Feedback
Person 1: 

- The search categories page could be prettier. All the categories are just in one line. Could maybe have them spaced out a bit more in different coulumns.

- Just an opinion but the Places to Eat page should default to showing all the vendors, or at least some of them rather than just being blank until a location is selected.

- Maybe combine the search and Places to Eat page.

- Like the rainbow colored font. 

- Looks pretty good overall and is honestly very usable. Could maybe change some of the fonts to make it look a little prettier instead of being one font.

Person 2:

- When using the search bar the categorical was to busy and should've been neater
I think adding a drop down option would've been a better choice

- The Fonts is kinda confusing. There were so many different fonts, which was something 
off about the website. 

- The rainbow colored font confused me but added some little different which is good. 

- The main menu was to small. The top back and the back part was smashing the middle 
menu. 

- The recommendation above the menu was a good touch. Having this makes to easier as a customer finding food that i want. 

Person 3:

- It looks good, almost professional looking.

- Easy to click on things and to use.

- Accommodating.

- Nice Design!

- Easy to access. 

Person 4: 

- Website is good cause we have places to eat split into locations and the search bar is there too in case they a looking for a specific place.
  
- The search filters are good, but would recommend a map for those who don't know the locations around manoa.
  
- "It's good cause it's simple."
